### Hi there! <img src="https://emojis.slackmojis.com/emojis/images/1536351075/4594/blob-wave.gif" width="30"/>

I'm Ashneet, a recent UC Irvine graduate with a degree in computer science and a specialization in information. 

Here on my GitHub, you'll find a mix of projects from courses and hackathons - full-stack web apps, search engine technologies, puzzle-solving algorithms, and more - all with detailed READMEs and many with demos.

I'm currently working on an updated version of a mobile sleeptracking app, and publishing several other finished projects. Stay tuned!
